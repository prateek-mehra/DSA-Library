c++ - int - signed 32 bit type
first bit is sign bit (0 for pos 1 for neg)
can store from -2^31 to 2^31-1 (both inclusive)

unsigned int can store from 0 to 2^32-1

Also, signed number x (n bits) = unsigned number 2^n-x

x&1 helps check parity of x
x&(2^k-1) helps check if x is exactly divisible by 2^k

x<<k appends k zero bits to the number
x>>k removes last k bits from the number
x&(1<<k) helps check kth bit of x
x|(1<<k) sets kth bit of x
x&~(1<<k) unsets kth bit of x
x^(1<<k)inverts kth bitof x
x&(x-1) unsets last set bit of x
x|(x-1) inverts all bits after last set bit
x&&(x&(x-1)==0) then x is a power of 2

union- x|y
intersection- x&y
complement- ~x
difference- x&(~y)

hamming distance- positions where the strings differ- __builtin_popcount(x^y)

a+b=a^b+2*(a&b)

brackets: for ex i&(1-1)==0 may give WA when used instead of (i&(i-1))==0

3 XOR SWAP
applying xor thrice on a,b will make it b,a..so in questions where xor operation is allowed mutiple times, the order of the elements won't matter
